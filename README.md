These files contain various assigments I completed and tested for BME 121: Digital Computation. They passed the test cases on marmoset, and demonstrate my proficiency in many principal c++ concepts.
Some of the concepts I applied in these assignements are arrays, **arrayLists**, i/o stream, **pointers/dynamic arrays,** **structs and classes**, and more.
